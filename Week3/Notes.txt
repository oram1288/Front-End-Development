Box Model in CSS:

In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins. The image below illustrates the box model:

# When you go live in html, go to inspect and then element to find box model there

Explanation of the different parts:

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

Ex. div {
        width: 300px;
        border: 15px solid green;
        padding: 50px;
        margin: 20px;
    }

Ex. div {                 # With height and width
        width: 320px;
        height: 50px;
        padding: 10px;
        border: 5px solid gray;
        margin: 0;
    }

Flexbox:

To start using the Flexbox model, you need to first define a flex container.
The element above represents a flex container (the blue area) with three flex items.
(look at flexbox on w schools)

"Flex: 1" takes the maximum space in the box
Could have 2 or 3 as well to take up different amounts of space equally

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div>3</div>
</div>
