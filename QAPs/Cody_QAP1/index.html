        <h2>The Great White</h2>
        <p>
          Carcharodon carcharias, mainly known as the <i>Great White Shark</i>,
          is one of 450 shark species and is the largest shark in the ocean
          today. Great White Sharks ancestry dates back more than
          <b>400 million years ago</b>, this beautiful creature represents one
          of the oceans primary apex predators. Great white sharks live in
          mostly all coastal and offshore waters which have water temperature
          between 12 and 24 <abbr title="Celcius">°C</abbr>(54 and 75
          <abbr title="Fahrenheit">°F</abbr>), with greater populations in the
          United States, South Africa, Japan and Chile. Great Whites often opt
          to keep their eyes open while sleeping, because some sharks must swim
          constantly to keep oxygen-rich water flowing over their gills, it has
          long been noted that some don't sleep at all. These apex predators get
          stressed in captivity and eventually die when they’re not in their
          natural environment. Due to their need to travel long distances for
          seasonal migration and their demanding diet, it is not logistically
          feasible to keep great white sharks in captivity.

        <h2>Great Whites Size, Diet and Natural Threats</h2>
        <p>
          Adult great white sharks can grow to a maximum size of about
          <u>20 feet</u> in length, weigh up to <u>6,600 pounds</u>, and are
          estimated to live for <u>30 years</u>. Deep Blue is a female great
          white shark that is estimated to be 6.1 m (20 ft) long or bigger and
          is now 60 years old. She is believed to be one of the biggest ever
          recorded in history. The shark was first spotted in Mexico by
          researcher
          <a href="https://www.pelagioskakunja.org/dr-mauricio-hoyos"
            >Mauricio Hoyos Padilla.</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The great white shark has a diverse diet of fish, invertebrates, and
          marine mammals. Young white sharks mainly eat bottom fish, smaller
          sharks and rays, and schooling fish and squids. Larger white sharks
          often gather around seal and sea lion colonies to feed and also
          occasionally scavenge dead whales. A Great White can devour a whole
          seal and wouldn't need to eat another meal for up to three months
          after that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Great whites only have one recorded natural predator, the orca.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca">Orcas</a>
          are the real apex predators of the ocean, they may be the only animals
          that actually prey on great white sharks. The species also faces
          numerous challenges which has resulted in international protection.
          Sharks are hunted for their fins and teeth and are often caught in the
          nets of commercial and illegal fishermen.

        <h2>Behaviour and Relationships with Humans/Attacks</h2>
        <p>
          Although these sharks are often classified as loners, there is a
          degree of social hierarchy that does exist among them. Female sharks
          often dominate males.
        </p>
        <p>
          While great whites are one of the few species known to have bitten and
          killed people, these events are extremely rare. Typically, when a
          white shark does bite a person, it only takes one exploratory bite and
          quickly realizes that the person is not its preferred prey.
        </p>
        <p>
          White sharks are among the top three shark species most likely to
          injure humans, alongside tiger sharks and bull sharks. But only
          <b>57 shark bites</b> were recorded in 2022, and that's across all
          shark species. There are far more survivors of white shark bites than
          there are fatalities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Great White Sharks rarely resort to combat with each other and humans.
          Even though shark attacks have occurred, research has shown that
          sharks are generally picky eaters and are not inclined to prey on
          humans.
        </p>

        <p>
          The great white shark is also known as the man-eating shark, from the
          the novel Jaws by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Benchley"
            >Peter Benchley</a
          >
          and the movie adaptation by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg"
            >Steven Spielberg</a
