Assessment Problems:
    1. For my research on the topic, i did it over the weekend so i would say 2 hours each day
    (saturday and sunday), setting up my page and figuring out how i wanted to style it was probably
    around 1-2 hours, adding in the text and figuring out how i wanted to lay out my page was around 
    4-5 hours, didnt want to rush anything. the finishing touches and adding anything that need to be
    added probably took about an hour.  (all are rough estimates)
    
    2. The resources i used was mainly your notes and lectures, i also looked back on some of my notes
    from semester 1 for reference as well, aswell as a few youtube videos.

    3. I never needed to ask any of my fellow classmates for help regarding solving any problems.

    4. I did ask one question to one of my instructors just regarding if something was required
    for our QAP1.

    5. I didnt find the difficulty of this QAP1 bad at all, i feel pretty confident in my abilities 
    going forward in the class, I feel like some things may be tricky at times to try and figure out 
    how you want to set certain things up but over time im sure it will become easier.
