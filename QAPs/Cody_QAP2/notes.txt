1.  Roughly did 2 questions a day, took me a while to look back and remember a few things, 
    I would take roughly 4 hours a day at the project.

2.  Used the lecture, youtube, and help from Kara.

3.  Never ask any classmates for help.

4.  Asked a few question to Kara, had 3 meetings.

5.  After completing this QAP I feel like I could solve similar questions, 
    but it might just take me a while cuz i feel like there is a lot of stuff 
    to remember and in figuring out how to set the function up for the question I'm answering

Sorry if this isnt the best answers/feedback, this was a last minute thing as i forgot 
all about the quesions lol.
