CSS: Cascading Style Sheet..

Rules:

1. Selector
2. the declarations

Types of Selectors:
1. Tag/Type selector... (h1{ } will be used for <h1>)
2. Class selector.. (we define a class with a period .demo { }) (class = "demo")
3. ID selectors... ( #box{}  ONLY one element can use it.. as id should be unique for each element)
4. Contextual selectors: (some element within other element) (ex. div h1{}, for any h1 inside of a div)
5.Grouping selectors (ex. h1,h2,h3{})

<span></span>... used to select a certain word to change its style

WHERE TO PUT CSS:
1. Inline css (Style within the element decalartion..)
    (Inline always over writes internal)
2. Internal CSS When we define style in the head..
    (Internal always over writes external)
3. External CSS   ** mainly used

Google Fonts for different font styles!!
("link" for html page and "import" for css)
(then copy the family name and put in into a <p> or <h1> etc.)

UNITS IN CSS:
1. em (2 times the size of the current font, ex. font-size: 2em)
2. rem
3. px
4. PUT
5. vw
6. vh
