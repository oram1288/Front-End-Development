            Hi, my name is Cody Oram and I'm 25 years old. I previously attended
            Memorial University where I completed my Criminology program. After
            that I looked for a change in fields and Software Development really
            caught my interest and I'm loving my journey in this field so far.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've always liked to challenge myself and continue to learn
            different things as this field continues to grow, which is very
            exciting. I'm a team player, I can work in groups or on my own no
            problem, I have good communication and problem-solving skills. I'm a
            determined and motivated person who puts the work in and wants to
            continue to improve. When I graduate, I hope to find a position in
            the near future that really catches my eye and somewhere I can grow
            as a person as well as a Software Developer.
