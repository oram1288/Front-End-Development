      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Cody Oram and I'm 25 years old. I previously attended
        Memorial University where I completed my Criminology program. After that
        I looked for a change in fields and Software Development really caught
        my interest and I'm loving my journey in this field so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always liked to challenge myself and continue to learn different
        things as this field continues to grow, which is very exciting. I'm a
        team player, I can work in groups or on my own no problem, I have good
        communication and problem-solving skills. I'm a determined and motivated
        person who puts the work in and wants to continue to improve. When I
        graduate, I hope to find a position in the near future that really
        catches my eye and somewhere I can grow as a person as well as a
        Software Developer.
